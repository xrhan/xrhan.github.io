I am a PhD student at Harvard University, advised by Prof. [Todd Zickler][todd]. I also work closely with Prof. [Ko Nishino][nishino] and have spent two wonderful summers in Kyoto.

Previously, I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science. During my undergrad, I was fortunate to work with Prof. [Jianbo Shi][jianbo] and Prof. [Dan Roth][danroth].

# Research

I am interested in computer vision, artificial intelligence and human perception/cognition.

# Miscellaneous
Outside of research, I enjoy visiting art museums, watching movies and learning philosophy and psychology.
