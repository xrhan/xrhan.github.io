I am a PhD student at Harvard University, advised by Prof. Todd Zickler. I also work closely with Prof. Ko Nishino and spent two wonderful summers in Kyoto.
Previously, I graduated from University of Pennsylvania with majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science. During my undergrad, I was fortunate to work with Prof. Jianbo Shi and Prof. Dan Roth.

# Research

I am interested in computer vision and artificial intelligence.
