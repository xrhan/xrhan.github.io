<br/><br/>
I am a PhD student at Harvard University, advised by Prof. [Todd Zickler][todd]. I also work closely with Prof. [Ko Nishino][nishino] and have spent two wonderful summers in Kyoto.

Previously, I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science. During my undergrad, I was fortunate to work with Prof. [Jianbo Shi][jianbo] and Prof. [Dan Roth][danroth].

# Research

My current research interests include 3D computer vision, generative models and multi-modal learning.

Specifically, I enjoy building models that combine learning based approach with physics intuition and inspirations from the human visual system. I'm also interested in the intersection of vision with language and art.

# Miscellaneous
Outside of research, I enjoy visiting art museums, watching movies and reading about philosophy and psychology.
