<p style="text-align: center;"> I am a PhD student at Harvard University, advised by Prof. [Todd Zickler](http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~zickler/Main/HomePage). I also work closely with Prof. [Ko Nishino](https://vision.ist.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp) and have spent two wonderful summers in Kyoto.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">  Previously, I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science. During my undergrad, I was fortunate to work with Prof. [Jianbo Shi](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~jshi/) and Prof. [Dan Roth](https://cogcomp.seas.upenn.edu).</p>

# Research

I am interested in computer vision, artificial intelligence and human perception/cognition.

# Miscellaneous
Outside of research, I enjoy visiting art museums, watching movies and learning philosophy and psychology.
